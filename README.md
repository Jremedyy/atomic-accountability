# Project Title

Atomic Accountability

## Description

This project demonstrates my expertise in developing robust and scalable web applications using Jakarta EE, Spring Data
JPA, and Spring MVC. Additionally, it leverages Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and improve development efficiency.

## Key Technologies

- **Jakarta EE**: Utilized for enterprise-level application structure and functionality.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Implemented to provide a consistent data access layer, abstracting complexities of CRUD
  operations.
- **Spring MVC**: Used to build the web layer, facilitating development of RESTful APIs and web applications.
- **Lombok**: Incorporated to minimize boilerplate code such as getters, setters, and constructors, enhancing code
  readability and maintenance.

## Features

- Comprehensive CRUD operations on entities.
- RESTful API endpoints for seamless interaction with frontend applications.
- Exception handling with custom error responses.
- Database integration using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Add Local PostgreSQL DB in CLI
   ```bash
   export DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   export DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

4. Build the project using Maven:
